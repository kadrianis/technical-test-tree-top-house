#Project: Forest Visibility Assessment
This project, developed in Java, focuses on assessing the visibility of trees within a specifically arranged grid. The arrangement represents a forest, and each tree's height is denoted by a digit from 0 to 9, with 0 as the shortest and 9 as the tallest tree.

#Problem Description
The primary objective is to count the number of trees that are visible from the outer boundary of the grid when viewed directly along a row or column. A tree is classified as visible if there are no taller trees between it and the edge of the grid. Trees on the grid's edge are automatically visible as there are no obstructions. The interior trees' visibility is determined by scanning each row and column in all four directions (up, down, left, and right).

The problem's context lies within the expedition that comes across a peculiar patch of tall trees, all planted carefully in a grid. The trees were part of a reforestation effort by a previous expedition, and there's a curiosity about whether this location would be good for a tree house. The visibility of the trees plays a crucial role in determining this.
